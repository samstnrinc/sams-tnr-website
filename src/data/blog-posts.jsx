        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-rust mt-8 mb-4">15 Cats and Counting in Quitman</h2>
        <p className="mb-6">
          This weekend's five cats mark a milestone. Over the past few months, Sam's TNR has now assisted a single Quitman homeowner in spaying or neutering <strong>15 cats</strong>. What started as a few strays showing up at the door grew into a colony — and without intervention, those 15 cats could have produced hundreds of kittens in just a few years.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-6">
          That's the math that makes TNR so critical. One unspayed female can produce up to three litters per year, with four to six kittens each. Multiply that across 15 unaltered cats, and the numbers escalate fast. Thanks to persistent effort and a willing homeowner, this colony is on the path to stabilization.

        <p className="mb-6">
          Quitman and Brooks County still have many cats in need. Stray and feral populations don't stabilize overnight — it takes sustained, community-wide effort. Every cat we spay or neuter is one less source of new litters, but there are always more cats waiting.

        <p className="text-xl text-gray-600 mb-8">If you've noticed cats roaming your neighborhood in Barney or northern Brooks County, you're not alone. These community cats—often called feral or stray cats—are part of a growing population that requires compassionate, evidence-based solutions. That's where TNR comes in.</p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-rust mt-8 mb-4">What Does TNR Stand For?</h2>
        <p className="mb-6"><strong>TNR</strong> stands for <strong>Trap-Neuter-Return</strong>, a humane method proven to effectively manage community cat populations. Here's how it works:</p>

        <div className="bg-gray-100 rounded-lg p-6 mb-8">
          <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-rust mb-3">TRAP</h3>
          <p className="mb-4">Community cats are humanely trapped using safe, specially designed traps. Experienced volunteers like those at Sam's TNR handle this process with care to minimize stress on the animals.</p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-rust mb-3">NEUTER</h3>
          <p className="mb-4">Cats are taken to licensed veterinarians who spay or neuter them under anesthesia. During surgery, they also receive:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc ml-6 mb-4">
            <li>Rabies and FVRCP vaccinations</li>
            <li>A wellness exam</li>
            <li>Ear-tipping (the universal sign of a TNR cat)</li>
            <li>Treatment for any immediate medical needs</li>
          </ul>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-rust mb-3">RETURN</h3>
          <p>After recovery, cats are returned to their familiar outdoor territory where they continue to live their lives—but without producing new litters.</p>
        </div>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-rust mt-8 mb-4">Why TNR Works: The Science Behind Success</h2>

        <div className="grid md:grid-cols-2 gap-6 mb-8">
          <div className="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-md p-6">
            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-rust mb-3">1. Breaks the Reproductive Cycle</h3>
            <p>A single unspayed female cat can produce up to 180 kittens in her lifetime. TNR stops this exponential growth immediately and humanely.</p>
          </div>
          
          <div className="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-md p-6">
            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-rust mb-3">2. Prevents the "Vacuum Effect"</h3>
            <p>Simply removing cats creates empty territory that attracts new cats from surrounding areas. TNR cats hold their territory, preventing newcomers from moving in.</p>
          </div>
          
          <div className="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-md p-6">
            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-rust mb-3">3. Reduces Nuisance Behaviors</h3>
            <p>Spayed and neutered cats are less likely to fight, don't spray or mark territory, make less noise, and are less aggressive overall.</p>
          </div>
          
          <div className="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-md p-6">
            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-rust mb-3">4. Cost-Effective Long-Term Solution</h3>
            <p>While the initial TNR investment requires resources, it's far more cost-effective than repeated removal attempts.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div className="bg-rust text-white rounded-xl p-8 text-center mb-8">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Real Results in Brooks County</h2>
          <p className="text-lg">Since our founding, <strong>Sam's TNR has spayed/neutered and vaccinated over 250 community cats</strong> in Barney and northern Brooks County. These cats are now living healthier lives while contributing to stable, managed colonies that don't produce new litters.</p>
        </div>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-rust mt-8 mb-4">How Long Does TNR Take to Work?</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">TNR results are both immediate and long-term:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc ml-6 mb-6">
          <li><strong>Immediate:</strong> No new pregnancies from TNR cats</li>
          <li><strong>6 months:</strong> Noticeable reduction in nuisance behaviors</li>
          <li><strong>2-3 years:</strong> Visible population stabilization</li>
          <li><strong>5+ years:</strong> Significant population reduction through natural attrition</li>
